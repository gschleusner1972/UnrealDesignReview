## Unreal Design Review for AEC

### Why?

The design process in AEC has been generating 3D models for many years.  These models come from BIM tools like Revit, ArchiCAD or BricsCAD BIM or modelers like Sketchup or Rhino.    Its always been a challenge to easily merge these models in a way enables designers to compare options, review materials, generate analysis or do simple things like early clash detection.  

There are tools made for clash detection, separate tools for exploring materials, still others for generating  analysis.   These tools go largely unused in the design process because no platform has made it easy to export data, assemble models and at the same time bring together disparate tools to view, review, clash, analyze etc.   

### Enter Unreal

In resent years Unreal engine and the tooling to support better AEC workflows have advanced to the point where its now possible to start to build such a tool.
